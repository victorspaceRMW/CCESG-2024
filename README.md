This is the source code of my paper: A Comparative Study of Four Air Conditioning Systems' Energy Consumption in Sydney, Australia Based on EnergyPlus and Data Science.

I use Python and JavaScript for the data visualization of the project. The core program is the .py files that is used for energy price calculation.

If you have any questions, please feel free to send me messages (I could read English, Chinese and Dutch) at: brianrwangmse@qq.com.
